# React-Express-boilerplate

A simple boilerplate for React, Webpack 4 and Express

## Features:

  * Optimized for production (using compression middleware and Webpack optimization plugins).
  * Supports SCSS/SASS.
  * Supports ES6 (No need to  bind the ```this``` context to each handler! )

## Getting Started

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kimo4444/react-express-boilerplate.git
$ npm install
```
To launch the app:

To use Webpack server: ```$ npm run dev-server```.
The app will automatically open at http://localhost:8080.
To use Express server: ```$ node server``` and open at http://localhost:3000.
And that is it, you are ready to start creating your app!
